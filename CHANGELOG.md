# Changelog

## 0.0.2 — 2026-03-12

- Fix project-local `/browse` installs — compiled binary now resolves `server.ts` from its own directory instead of assuming a global install exists
- `setup` rebuilds stale binaries (not just missing ones) and exits non-zero if the build fails
- Fix `chain` command swallowing real errors from write commands (e.g. navigation timeout reported as "Unknown meta command")
- Fix unbounded restart loop in CLI when server crashes repeatedly on the same command
- Cap console/network buffers at 50k entries (ring buffer) instead of growing without bound
- Fix disk flush stopping silently after buffer hits the 50k cap
- Fix `ln -snf` in setup to avoid creating nested symlinks on upgrade
- Use `git fetch && git reset --hard` instead of `git pull` for upgrades (handles force-pushes)
- Simplify install: global-first with optional project copy (replaces submodule approach)
- Restructured README: hero, before/after, demo transcript, troubleshooting section
- Six skills (added `/retro`)

## 0.0.1 — 2026-03-11

Initial release.

- Five skills: `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/browse`
- Headless browser CLI with 40+ commands, ref-based interaction, persistent Chromium daemon
- One-command install as Claude Code skills (submodule or global clone)
- `setup` script for binary compilation and skill symlinking
